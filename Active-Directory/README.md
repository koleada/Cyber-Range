### Active Directory 

As I've mentioned many times in this repo, Active Directory is the centerpiece of this lab and the main reason I wanted to create this home lab. 

I'm not exactly sure what it is about AD, but I find it so interesting, like all aspects of it to, the mangement, troubleshooting, configuration, and, of course, the securiyt side of things. I guess, it just feels like such a technical marvel to me.
