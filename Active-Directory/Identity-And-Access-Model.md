# Identity & Access Model 

This document will describe what I, through doing my research, believe to be at least a good way to structure, manage, and assign privileges to identities within an Active Directory domain. 

Identity Design involves creating a structured framework for managing user, machine, and service accounts, and determining what resources each account should have access to. This is where we heavily rely on smart organization of domain accounts via the use of organizational units and groups to increase overall security, scalability, and efficient administration. 

For admins of Active Directory, this, I believe, is the real meat and potatoes, meaning this is a foundational part of any AD admins work, and also largely defines an organizations security posture
