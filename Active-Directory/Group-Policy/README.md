### Group Policy (GPO) - Design, Implementation, & Security Controls

Group policy is one of the most powerful components of Active Directory. We touched on it briefly regarding the identity model, but here we will go a lot further.

In my cyber range AD enviornment, group policy is not just used as centalized configuration adn management console, it's also used as a primary security control plane that I becaame familiar with using to modify and secure authentication behavior, privleidge boundaries, network security, and attack surface. 

In this doc, I will detail how I learned and performed designing, structuring, and applying GPO within my lab enviornemnt specificalyl in by explaining the following:

1. Practice GPO design principles
2. Policy processing behavior and scope
3. Identity and authentication controls
4. Workstation and server configuration enforcement
5. Foundational security hardening via GPO
