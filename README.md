# Cyber-Range 

This cyber range is built to resemble an enterprise network while also saving me, as a broke college student, from having to spending a ton of money on real hardware, software licenses, paid labs/ education and so forth.

## Project Overview 

My goal with this was to build a full fledged mini network both to demonstrate my knowledge to others, help others with designing their own home lab, and also to learn more about administrating and red teaming on 'real' networks. I've always been very interested in active directory so one of my main focuses with this lab was to really dive in to it both from an administration/ configuration standpoint and regarding various cyber attacks and defenses specific to AD. Additionally, I have a goal of becoming an pentester and getting certifications like OSCP (once I can actually afford it) so I figured having a true cyber range set up would help me out later on in my career as well.
